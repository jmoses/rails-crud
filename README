# What is rails-crud?

rails-crud is a plugin that abstracts a bunch of the repetitive CRUD actions out. Like scaffold, but I hate scaffold.

# Installation

Install it like a regular plugin.

# Usage

class Pastry < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :name
end

class PastriesController
  include CRUD::Base
end

Ta-da.

Really, that's it.

Your controller has to be the plural of your model.  Has to.

You'll get the following actions:

* index
* new
* create
* edit
* update
* destroy

They're ugly as sin, but they'll work like you want, and they're easily stylable.

# Customizations

You can customize the following views:

* field layout on the forms 
* column layout on index

You can customize the following behavior:

* some.  seriously, this is new documentation.  I'll get to it.  Or look at the code.  It's not terribly complicated.  Fork, update the docs and send me a pull request

# Requirements:

* haml
* validation_reflection (not *really* required, but trust me, you'll want it.)
* formtastic
